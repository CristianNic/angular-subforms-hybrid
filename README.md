# Angular Subforms

This demo addresses a very specific need: To add FormGroup components to a parent FormGroup while retaining the layout of the orignal form.

The goal is to add modular sections to an existing form without having to rewrite the existing form into components.

The original parent form with the full name section now has two new child components attached: the address-info-subform and the order-details-subform.
